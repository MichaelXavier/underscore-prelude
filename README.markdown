Underscore Prelude
------------------

A half-baked port of Haskell's [Prelude](http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Prelude.html) as an extension to [Underscore.js](http://github.com/documentcloud/underscore). I say half baked because I don't really want to port all of the datatypes over, but rather only the functions that can operate on Javascript's existing data types.
